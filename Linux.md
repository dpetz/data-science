#Linux and the Command Line

Data Scientists without Computer Science background are sometimes not fully aware how important understanding Unix and its command line is. Two books I found helpful are [How Linus Works][1] and [Data Science at the Command Line][2]. Here are my notes.

## How Linux works



# Shell Commands:

* Text Files: cat, grep, less, vi, head tail, diff
* Navigate: ls, cd, rm, cp, mv, touch, mkdir, rmdir, 
* Other: pwd, file, 


The shell expands wildcards (_globbing_)
